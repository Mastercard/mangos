# PCR 7:  Secure Boot state; changes when UEFI SecureBoot mode is enabled/disabled,
#         or firmware certificates (PK, KEK, db, dbx, ...) changes.
# PCR 11: systemd-stub(7) measures the ELF kernel image, embedded initrd and other
#         payload of the PE image it is placed in into this PCR. systemd-
#         pcrphase.service(8) measures boot phase strings into this PCR at various 
#         milestones of the boot process.
#
# Binding the key to PCR 11 means it'll only be usable if the measured values of
# the loaded UKI match the embedded signed policy, signed by our key.
#
# Binding the key to PCR 7 means it will NOT be available if the Secure Boot
# policy has been modified.
